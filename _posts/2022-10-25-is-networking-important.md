It was a lovely morning and my girlfriend and I were about to start our day---going to starbucks and staying **6+ hours** studying and doing work---when all of a sudden, we saw the man beside us was doing a complex `Python` code. Being the shy one in the relationship, I just shrugged myself off and just assumed that he was just a student studying computer science. The starbucks was also close to `Texas Tech` as well so it's a good assumption. But my girlfriend, the brave one, asked if he was a software engineer, he said "yes" My eyes got bigger than the croissant I was eating. It was as if you met a professional basketball player. At that brief moment, I got super ecstatic.

*Then the interview began.*

We interviewed him **non-stop** as if he was holding a press conference about his life and his journey in becoming a software engineer. We talked about his experiences in applying for a software engineer job and how he got into one of the big companies in `Dallas`. He explained it very well that the process was not easy and that there is competitiveness in the field. Nonetheless, he emphasized to just try and try until you get into a company. It does not matter if it is big or small but having experiences helped in getting a job.

*Then the networking began.*

Before we let our hostage go, we asked if we could connect with him through `LinkedIn` and fortunately enough, he accepted it. He even gave the go signal to refer him if ever we would apply to the same position that he has. We were shocked. Utterly shocked. It was a touching moment that gave us a boost in our morale in being in a top company in the future.

Now imagine if you meet multiple Bob (that was just a fake name I made for the person we met) in different companies. You would have multiple connections. You would increase your chance in getting a job instead of just staying silent and just applying through the company's online website. 

{: .box-note}
Multiple connection = higher the chance of getting a job

I'm sure that not all of them would be as kind as bob, but the more you know the experiences from people, the more you gain knowledge about job hunting.

You may never know, you might get your first job through a connection ðŸ˜‰.
