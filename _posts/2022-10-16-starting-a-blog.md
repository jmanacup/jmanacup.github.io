Given the fact that I already graduated from College and now working a full-time job, I thought to myself.... Why did I suddenly created a personal blog? Is it for fame? Is it for my job hunting, or to create another project I would not touch again. The answer, as simple as it is, is because,

<center><h2>I just want to share!</h2></center>

Ever since I came to being (not exactly, but you get the point), I have been keeping all of my ideas to myself and myself only. Every family dinner that I had in the past, I would usually just sit there quiety and just hear the opinions of my parents and my brothers, but not really engaging to it. I would just do a slight nod as a confirmation that I am there and I agree but in my heart, there were moments were I am completely against it.

But now it is different. I saw that sharing has more advantages to other people than me and really, that's what really matters to me. I was selfish before about the stuff I know since it will give me more advantages that other people but in the long run, it is not really worth it.

{: .box-note}
In a selfish world, we need people who are selfless.

So here I am starting to share with y'all the things that I have learned throughout my life, experiences that I encountered in my journey in life, as well as, the realizations that may relate to you and help things out even for a little bit.
