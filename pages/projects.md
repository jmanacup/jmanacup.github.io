I remember when I was in 3rd grade, my mother showed me an application she made in Excel where when you typed in your `name`, the bottom cell will show `Welcome John`. I was really amazed and mesmerized at a simple silly program. But little did I know, the feeling and the passion of creating applications and projects grew more and more and now that I am old enough to do programs (not just a silly `hello world!`), I can showcase it and show to the whole world what programming is capable of.

# Web Development

I have been experimenting my skills in web development way back 4th grade by creating `Webly` and `Wix` website and actually learning the concept of `CMS`. It was not until just recently I really honed my skills in web development, both in front-end and back-end. I was a little bit outdated as when I was starting, I only knew `LAMP` stack, but now I am currently learning some of the web development standards and using web frameworks such as `Angular` and `React`

<div style="text-align: center;"><h2><a href="https://wang-data-science.com">WANG DATA SCIENCE</a></h2></div>

Wang Data Science is a website that we have built using Wordpress and ol' but trusted LAMP stack and deployed in AWS.

 I am really proud of this project that me and my co-worker made together as we learned everything from top to finish. We've also learned things that are outside of our scope and how important some of them were. For instance, we've encountered the horrible experiences of people hacking through our website, accessing our SSH keys, and ultimately, corrupting our files. It was devastating as we have spent almost weeks and had to rebuilt our website again from scratch due to that incident. Luckily, we've learned a lot by doing best practice in making our Wordpress secured! We've installed security defender plugins, created our own SSL certificate, and installed Wordpress CLI for weekly checks of file integrity.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h2 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/ACMTTU/acm-note-sharing-platform">ACM NOTE-SHARING PLATFORM</a></h2></div>

ACM note-sharing platform is a web-app that aims to help Texas Tech University studentsby providing a gateway to create, share, and collobarate notes in their respective courses. This web app is done through `.NET framework`, `Microsoft Azure`, `CosmosDB`, and `React`.

This is my very first collaboration project as there are a lot of members involved. I was assigned as one of the people in charge of the back-end. I learned a lot, especially communicating with fellow colleagues about their updates and parts as we were in a time crunch (it is only 1 semester long project). This project also thought me alot of `REST API` concepts as well as `Git` commands and handling **merge conflicts** (YES! MERGE CONFLICTS! ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ) 

# Mobile Development

I started to develop an interest with mobile development after enrolling to **CodePath**. I have been curious in developing mobile apps as I remember just developing a game kinda like [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird). Currently I have only touched `Android` and `React-Native` as the framework for creating such but I am interested in learning `Swift` for `iOS` as well.

Seefood is an Android app that uses Google's text processing and outputs images of the digitized menu.

This is a final **CodePath** group project where we create an Android app to "See" food menus with limited images and food pictures. Since we are a diversed group of people, we thought about a scenario we often encounter in our daily lives and of course, it relates to food ðŸ˜‹! We are a bunch of food addicts and we try, as much as possible, to explore different cuisines that our city offers such as Thai, Vietnamese, Filipino and many more but often times, the restaurants would only provide the name of the food and some short description and we would just have a hard time searching the food that we would want to eat. So we came up with an idea to use Google's text recognition and automatically gives the image of the listing of the food so that we can picture the food and learn about it. We had tons of fun in creating this project as it showcases our satisfying culture in food as well as help other people who have the same desires as us in terms of exploring variety of food their city has to offer!

**P.S.** If you are a college student and would want to expand your skills, I would highly suggest going to [CodePath](https://www.codepath.org/). It is completely free and are made up of the best people who are into tech. Some of the tech fellows are volunteered professional who have worked in top companies such as **SnapChat**, **Facebook**, and **Uber** and you will definitely learn a lot from their experiences. They also host virtual career fairs with some of the top companies so you'll be able to showcase your skills and talents as well!

<div style="text-align: center;"><h2 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/DroidTech-TTU/findteam_android_v1.0">FINDTEAM</a></h2></div>

![Findteam](../../assets/img/findteam-demo.gif){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Findteam is an Android app that lets people from all around the work to connect and collaborate in a team with their common interest.

This is my `CS 4000` capstone project. It was a project where me and my groupmates decided, given the time crunch that we're only allowed (1 semester), to work on and accomplish as a finish product and not just a prototype. This is also my first time creating an Android app as I was learning alongside with Codepath Android Course this time. I learned a lot especially in setting up a full-stack mobile app development. I remember learning what `FastAPI` is and `MariaDB`, as well as, hosting them in `Oracle` database. It was also my first time encountering and using `Docker` in this project which I was amazed at how blazing fast it compiles. I would say that we did a pretty solid job in creating this as I remember that we would meet multiple times every week to try and assess our progress with the app alongside multiple documentation that we had to do (Software Design and Database Structure). If ever we would have time to finish the app, we hinted that we can do this through a full-blown web app where a lot more audience may be able to reach it.
