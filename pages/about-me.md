My name is John Manacup. I am a programmer at day and a programmer at night.... I have a burning passion in learning everything that relates with computer science!

# My story

I grew up the **Philippines** and spent most of my life there. I remember just hanging around with my friends all day playing game and being in cyber cafes, playing basketball with my brothers as early as 6 a.m., and just enjoying delicious Filipino food that I crave everyday, just like this [Food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taho#/media/File:Taho2.jpg) right here.....

**ANYWAY**, I studied a lot. **A LOT** and I guess you could say that the Asian study culture is true as I did nothing but study. While it was not the fun and exciting part of my life, I met a lot of great people and learned a lot from them. I miss every single moment that I had with my friends and even though we don't see each other much often (they are too far ðŸ˜¢), I am still proud of them of what they accomplished in their life. I also gamed a lot as well, I remember the time where one whole summer, I did nothing but played **Dota**. I even made friends because we play the same game as well. I was not a good gamer. Just a competitive one ðŸ˜‰.

My computer science passion started when I was in 3rd grade. I was playing Pinball on my computer and a blue screen just popped out of nowhere. Little did I know that it was a blue screen of death (BSOD) and I knew that I had to fix it before my mother comes home or else I'll be sent to heaven with her belt. Luckily, I got off pretty nicely by just restarting the computer but, it piqued my interest on the words that was presented in the screen.

Many years have passed, and I started to learn basic programming skills starting with `HTML` during 4th grade and `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `SQL` during my high school life. I remember replicating a pizza app where people can order with certain quantity and show the final bill. The program did not finish as nice as I wanted to as it was requesting more money as the total (talk about corruption in a very young age). Nonetheless, even though programming was challenging, I really feel the thrill of coding and learning something and thinking like a computer.

Times have passed and I was already in my 11th grade of high school. Bittersweet, I had to say goodbye to my friends as I head on a new journey in my life---living in the states. I was fortunate enough to go here in the states to learn more about computer science and be very good at it. I graduated in **Texas Tech University** just last May and I just want to dedicate my success to the nice people and professor that helped me throughout my computer science journey.

Currently, I am a `programmer analyst` at Texas Tech University that focuses on data processing using `R`. In my free time, I just make my own projects and explore different fields of computer science such as **mobile development**, **web development**, and many more!

Hope I did not bore you out! Feel free to check out my upcoming blogs as well as my projects [here](https://github.com/jmanacup) as well as **projects** tab and have a wonderful day! ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¯
